        <p class="page-details">The first principle we'll delve into is recognizing that in life, only a handful of things are truly important. <br><br> In a world filled with noise, distractions, and endless opportunities, it's easy to spread ourselves too thin. But the secret to a fulfilling life lies in identifying your "vital few" — the essential elements that bring you joy, fulfillment, and meaning. <br><br> The following journal prompts aim to guide you in this enlightening journey of discovery.</p>

        <p class="page-details">The third principle, "You'll Never Get It All Done (So Don't Even Try)," challenges the societal myth of the "superhuman" who can handle every task, opportunity, and challenge flawlessly. Instead, it asks you to embrace the liberating concept of prioritization—of admitting that some things will not get done, and that's perfectly okay. By giving yourself the permission to focus only on what's essential, you pave the way for more meaningful, high-quality contributions to your life and the lives of others.</p>
